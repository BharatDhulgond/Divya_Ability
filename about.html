        <h3 class="section-header">Who We Are</h3>
        <p>
          Founded in February 2024, DivyaAbility Foundation is a registered Section 8 non-profit organization in India dedicated to empowering people with disabilities.<br>
          We transform lives by making disability inclusion real — through inclusive education, digital skills training, mentorship, scholarships, and community programs.<br>
          We believe true inclusion goes beyond physical access — it means changing perceptions, creating opportunities, and empowering every person to learn, grow, and lead.

        <h3 class="section-header">Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          At its core, disability inclusion is not an act of charity — it’s a shared responsibility.<br>
          By investing in inclusive education, skill development, and digital literacy, we help turn potential into purpose, and hope into action.
